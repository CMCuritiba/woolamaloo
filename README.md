# Woolamaloo University

The famous Woolamaloo University is coming to town.
Their tradition will help improve the opportunities and cultural exchange in our region.
To accomplish this they need help with a synchronization system.
The data of all the employees are managed by one system.
All their web applications uses an authentication system that is based on the department and/or position to give or take permissions.

# The task

Your mission if you dare accept it, is to read the data exported from the employees system, compare against the data exported from the web auth system and generate a simple report.

# Employees system data specification

The employees system holds information of all employees including personal data, positions, department, payment, and more.
For this job only some information are useful, so the IT team provided a convenient simplified file.
The employees data file follows this standard:

```
id,name,admission_date,demission_date,department,position
```

Important, demission_date only have a value if the employee is not working on the University of Woolamaloo anymore.

Sample data:

```
id,name,admission_date,demission_date,department,position
1234,Aldo Zanchertine,13/11/1991,,Philosophy,Professor
4321,Rufus Parket,11/05/1996,14/10/2000,Transportation,Driver
```
